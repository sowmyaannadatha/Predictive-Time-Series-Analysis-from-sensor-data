Time series - centrifuges dataset (Publicly available dataset)

Introduction:
Proof of Concept study.
This public dataset is from a sewage water recycling unit.
The recyling plant has 4 centrifuges to seperate fluids of different densities . (liquids from solids)
The liquid is processed in such a way that the water is safe to return to environment.
The solids are processed into organic fertilizers.


Problem Statement:
The centrifuges are stopping all of sudden leaving damages that could take several days for repair.They don't know which features are effecting the stop.
Predict Unwanted and uncontrollable stop of centrifuge with data from sensors.
They want to develop an alarming system that could handle sudden stop of centrifuge.


Dataset :
The Dataset has one year (Jun 2019 to May 2020) of minutes data of 4 centrifuges collected from 21 sensors.


Conclusion :- 
The differential RPM is set by the manufacturer depending on the need of the costumer. The fluctuations in differential RPM is causing an imbalance between centrifuge bowl speed and scroll.
A piece of centrifuge is broken as a result of this fluctuation. When fluctuations are observed it is always good to calibrate differential rpm and do preventive maintanence.
